# PID 101 for Robotics

The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control structure is widely used but sometimes blindly applied and poorly understood.  These two notebooks—with examples written in Python—provide an brief and systematic introduction to PID control.  Practitioners in robotics are the intended audience, although the concepts are applicable more broadly.

## Part I: Basics

The first notebook (Part I) provides a hands-on introduction to the feedback control of simple single-input, single-output (SISO) systems.  What is perhaps unique about this notebook is that we introduce PID control solely in the time domain (i.e., without reliance on Laplace domain techniques), which is arguably more intuitive.

Readers already experienced with PID control can skip this notebook.

## Part II: Tuning

The second notebook (to come) will introduce some practical ways for choosing PID gains (i.e., _tuning_) that work especially well for robotics applications.
